3. On the Projects section. click on the settings icon and select `my_debtors_team_32` and also set the status to `Todo`
4. Create a new branch in your laptop to begin working on the issue. For clarity, give the new branch a name similar to the issue/feature you are working on. E.g If you are adding a new button to the home page, your new branch name can be `add-button-to-home`.
5. For now, when creating a new page, create your html and css files in the public folder. Your html and css files should have the same name for easy identification. E.g A `landing-page.html` file should have a css file name of `landing-page.css`.
6. Once you are done, ensure you commit your changes to the newly created branch and push to the remote repository on that same branch.
```

git push origin <your branch name>
